# Roman Emperors Web Application
A quick and easy use of the Roman Emperors API from the opendatasoft website. The API lists 68 Roman emperors, from 26 BC to 395 AD, so from Augustus to Theodosius I, who was the last emperor of a unified empire before the permanent split. While the data is useful and very easy to use and manage, some of the data is inaccurate, in particular the Dynasty prop, so I omitted that data from this application. 

## Features
Fetches data from the API and sorts it in ascending order by the index of each emperor.
Dynamically displays the data of each emperor in a card in a clear and vibrant formant.
For the styling I decided on using colors historically associated with the Roman Empire and its emperors: red, gold, and purple.
Information displayed on each emperor will give the reader a quick understanding of their life.
